## Why Linux Mint?

I am using Linux Mint as the base for this project because it strikes a strong balance between stability and pragmatism. While Mint is based on Ubuntu, it avoids certain design decisions, most notably Snap packages, that do not align with how I want this system to work. That alone makes it a better foundation for my goals.

Mint is also an excellent beginner distribution, which is important for what I am trying to demonstrate. It provides solid, well integrated tooling out of the box, including a reliable installer, Timeshift for system snapshots, and a driver manager that works without friction. These fundamentals help the system feel complete and usable, and they provide a strong base to build something more opinionated on topof. This system is inspired by Omarchy.

## Why Hyprland?

Hyprland represents a deliberate move away from the traditional Windows like desktop paradigm seen in floating window managers such as KDE Plasma or Cinnamon. These environments are not bad. They are excellent choices for users who want familiarity and comfort, especially when coming from Windows. As I spend more time moving away from Windows entirely, I care less about replicating that experience and more about shaping my system to fit how I work. Tiling window managers, and Hyprland in particular has everything I'm looking for in this project, unlike i3 or sway which while good are somewhat more "clunky".

With this project, my goal is to showcase a stable, clean, and thoughtfully configured Hyprland setup built on top of Mint. It is not about chasing minimalism for its own sake, but about demonstrating how a solid beginner friendly base can support a highly personalised and modern Linux environment.
